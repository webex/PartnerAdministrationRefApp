# ModifyCallQueueObjectAlternateNumberSettings

The alternate numbers feature allows you to assign multiple phone numbers or extensions to a call queue. Each number will reach the same greeting and each menu will function identically to the main number. The alternate numbers option enables you to have up to ten (10) phone numbers ring into the call queue.
